Some .files.
----
Take a look inside `install.sh`, it will install a lot of different things that I use.
It will also run `deploy.sh` inside other folders, which wipes your configs, 
and places mine there instead. Run this at your own risk.


run by: 

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git
git clone https://github.com/exoji2e/dotfiles
cd dotfiles
./install.sh
```
